Notes about human_action_recognition model (mmaction2's UniFormerV2):

we ran our code on cpu, because our device on has 4GB of dedicated GPU memory, our har requires more than that. So if your GPU on your device has a at least 8GB of dedicated GPU memory, you can just comment line 16 and uncomment line 14 (for both analyse_vid and analyse_vid2), so that it uses that gpu, instead of cpu for a faster runtime.

analyse_vid.py is for listing out top5 actions in the video

analyse_vid2.py is for saving the top5 actions in a json file and saving the analysed videos
